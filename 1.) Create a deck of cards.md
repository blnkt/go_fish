1.) Create a deck of cards

2.) create two players
    A: Each player will have a "hand of cards"

3.) deal random cards to both players

4.) Card Logic:
    A.) Method that asks opposing player if they have a card. If true then asking player recieves that card, if false then asking player recieves random card from the "deck"
    B.) method that checks to see if a player has 4 matching cards in his "hand"
      I.) method that holds a "book" of each 4 of a kind a player has aquired.
5.) checks to see if the game is over yet (deck exhausted, who has the most books)
